# AM2320_temperature_humidity_sensor
Simple library for the AM2320 Temperature and humidity sensor using the Atmega328p MCU.

## Gettings Started
Basic example of reading the Temperature and Humidity data from the AM2320 sensor:
```
i2c_init();
float temp = 0.0;
float humi = 0.0;
while(1) {
  AM2320_update_temperature_humidity();
  temp = AM2320_get_temperature_float();
  humi = AM2320_get_humidity_float();
  **DO STUFF WITH READINGS**
  **delay at least 2 seconds**
}
```
The datasheet reccomends at least a 2 second interval between readings as this reduces
the amount of heat generated by the component allowing for more accurate readings.
